Executive Summary
-----------------

As student’s in the Computer Engineering Technology program, we will be
integrating the knowledge and skills we have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will connect to a database as well as to a
mobile device application. The internet connected hardware will include a custom
PCB with various sensors. The database will store historical production and
weather data. The mobile device functionality will include the ability to view
the system status, DC output power overview, weather factors, past power
production data and will be further detailed in the mobile application proposal.
This semester I plan to continue working with Richard Burak and Salvatore
Angilletta, who also built similar hardware last term and have worked on the
mobile application. The hardware has been completed in CENG 317 Hardware
Production Techniques independently and the application has been completed in
CENG 319 Software Project. These will be integrated together this term in CENG
355 Computer Systems Project as a member of a 3 student group.

 

Background
----------

The problem solved by project is how to track a solar panel system. With the
purposed hardware and companion mobile application it will allow solar panel
owner the ability to easily monitor their system status, track their power
production, view historical production data, and view weather data from a web
interface and simple mobile application.

The hardware, powered by a Broadcom development platform, will operate in series
with a solar panel system. Information will be gathered to indicate if all is
well with the system and power production overview. Multiple sensors such as
temperature, humidity, barometric sensors will be used to gather weather data.
Weather data will be available to view at a glance and historically. With this
data you understand performance variations day to day.

I have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content” and have found and read three which provide insight into
similar efforts.

The first journal discusses how shade can reduce power generation up to 10-20%
annually.[@6892936]

The second journal discusses low cost options for measuring solar panel defects.
[@5762585]

The third and final journal we found provides information about how extreme high
temperature can affect solar panel degradation. [@7072567]

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering,

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

-   Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

-   Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable me to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

 

Methodology
-----------

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project:  
Phase 1 Hardware build.  
Phase 2 System integration.  
Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

*Phase 1 Hardware build*

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration has been completed in the winter term.

*Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers*

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

Abstract
========

Home owners, who posses solar power generation systems, have difficulty easily
accessing power production information and determining the effect of
environmental elements. To address this, a product must be created to assist in
the monitoring and collection of data to clearly determine power production and
its relationship with weather factors. This product monitors solar cell voltage
generation, surrounding temperature, light levels, barometric pressure, and
humidity. Data retrieved from the sensors is processed on the Broadcom
development platform before being sent to a co-located database. Each entry in
the database has a date and time associated with it to provide context. The
database stores the sensor data and is accessed by both the Android mobile
application and the online web interface. The Android mobile application
displays the data in an easy-to-read manner for the end user with the option to
view it in a graph. The online web interface provides the same functionality
with a more interactive approach. This product has the potential to enhance
solar panel ownership and research by allowing users to intuitively manage their
solar power generation system.

[1.] Introduction
=================

In the current marketplace home owners, who posses solar power generation
systems, have difficulty easily accessing power production information and
determining the effect of environmental elements. Home owners have adopted a
relatively new technology and should be confident in knowing that information
regarding it is always available. Since this product automates the collection
and distribution of the data, the responsibility of the home owner is minimized.

With this product it will grant solar panel owners the ability to easily monitor
their system status, track their power production, view historical production
data, and view weather data from an interactive display and simple mobile
application.

The hardware, powered by a Broadcom development platform, will operate in series
with a solar panel system. Information will be gathered to indicate if all is
well with the system and power production overview. Multiple sensors such as
light, temperature, humidity, barometric pressure sensors will be used to gather
weather data. Weather data will be available to view at a glance and
historically.

This product uses an off-site database which can be accessed through both the
online web interface and Android mobile application. This will allow the end
user to monitor their solar panel power generation system from a remote
location.

A goal when creating this product was to follow a tight budget so the cost of
building it has remained relatively low. The price for consumers should remain
low and researchers will have a low-cost monitoring solution.

Following AGPLv3, all of our source code will be made available online for
public viewing. This is due to the Android application using GraphView and our
firmware using Adafruit Python libraries.

[2.1] Software Requirements Specifications
------------------------------------------

### [2.1.1] Product Introduction

### [2.1.1.1] Purpose

This product is to be used in tandem with a solar power generation system. It is
meant to enhance solar panel ownership by providing an intuitive way of
gathering and examining data for both home owners and researchers.

 

### [2.1.1.2] Intended Audience

This document is intended for industry professionals and educational
institutions for research and evaluation.

 

### [2.1.1.3] Product Scope

The product is built using a Broadcom development platform to interface with a
solar cell and a variety of sensors. All of the data is gathered using these
on-board sensors, which collect information about the humidity, temperature,
barometric pressure, and light level around the hardware. Because the power
generation of the solar cell is also tracked, it can be correlated with the
weather data and used to further our research into solar energy.

 

### [2.1.2] Overall Description

### [2.1.2.1] Product Perspective

This product is aimed to be a new way to gather and display data from any
existing solar power generation system.

 

### [2.1.2.2] Product Functions

The various sensors are tasked with gathering the raw data. The DHT-11 is used
for humidity, the BMP085 for barometric pressure and temperature, the YL-40 for
light-levels, and finally a solar cell may be connected and have its voltage
generation measured. The development platform contains software to convert this
raw data into readable values. These values are then uploaded to a remote
database for future access. This database can be read using either the Android
application or the online web interface.

 

### [2.1.2.3] User Classes and Characteristics

The expected user of this product is any homeowner with a private solar power
generation system. The software interface is geared towards being simple and
accessible for casual smartphone users. A secondary user base can include
researchers looking to further work in solar panel technology.

 

### [2.1.2.4] Operating Environment

The mobile application must run on Android API 19 and above, on either a
smartphone or tablet device. The software running on the development platform is
designed to work with a Linux-based operating system. Finally, the database uses
MySQL and is accessed with PHP scripts.

 

### [2.1.2.5] User Documentation

Users will have access to hardware build instructions that provide a
step-by-step guide for putting the product together. Instructions for the Linux
software configuration are included as part of the build instructions.

 

### [2.1.3] External Interface Requirements

### [2.1.3.1] Database

The MySQL database will run on a co-located free-hosting website. The database
will use phpMyAdmin to for administrative interaction on the front-end. The
information contained includes formatted data downloaded from the development
platform. There are two tables, one with a username and password for the Android
app users, and on with entries for all the weather data collected (power,
temperature, light, barometric pressure, humidity, and time). The database will
be populated by data downloaded from the hardware.

(Developed by Richard Burak)

 

### [2.1.3.2] Mobile Application

The mobile application, available on Android platforms, will take the data from
the MySQL database and temporarily store it on the target device in memory. It
will display the data in an easy-to-read manner for the end user. There is the
option to view the data in a graph. The user can customize to see a different
range of historical data. The application has a total of three activities:
login, main and a settings. The login activity allows the user to log into an
account and have access to their data. The main activity has two areas; The main
area contains the user’s homepage and the other contains the graph. The settings
activity allows the user to change the temperature notation from Celsius to
Fahrenheit.

(Developed by Salvatore Angilletta)

 

### [2.1.3.3] Online Web Interface

An online web interface will be developed and mirror the functionality of the
mobile application. After the user logs in they will have access to their data
in an easy-to-read manner. On a single page, the web interface will contain the
users most recent data and a table containing historical data. An option will be
available for the user to change the temperature notation from Celsius to
Fahrenheit.

(Developed by Steven Spiteri)

 

### [2.1.3.4] Additional Hardware

A new top for the product casing will be laser cut to allow mounting of the
solar cell and allow routing for the solar cell connection.

[3.5] Development Platform Setup
--------------------------------

Once the Broadcom development platform has been acquired, begin by connecting it
to a display. Next, connect the keyboard and mouse. You can now plug the
development platform into power and begin configuring the operating system. The
setup will be explained on screen, and you may begin using the development
platform once it has completed. In the top right-hand corner of the screen,
select the network you want the development platform to automatically connect to
when it boots up (skip this step if the device is using a wired connection). Be
sure to make note of the IP address, as it may be required later if remotely
connecting to the device. The IP can be found by hovering the mouse over the
WiFi symbol on the top-right. Once connected to the internet, open the command
line terminal and run the following command:

sudo apt-get update

This will update the development platform to the most recent version. This is
important, as security updates are required to keep the device safe. Next, SSH
must be enabled by default, otherwise you will not be able to remotely access
the development platform. To ensure SSH starts when the development platform is
booted up, run this in the command line:

mv /boot/boot_enable_ssh.rc /boot/boot.rc

Now that SSH is enabled, VNC must be installed and enabled. VNC allows users to
navigate the GUI of the development platform remotely. To install this, run the
following commands:

sudo install tightvncserver tightvncserver

Setup a password for VNC when asked. You will now be able to run VNC server by
accessing the development platform through SSH, then interface using any VNC
client. To prepare the development platform for use with the sensors, I2C must
be enabled. To do this, start by running the following command:

sudo raspi-config

Use the arrow keys to navigate to advanced options and hit enter. Once there,
navigate to I2C and hit enter again. Select "Yes" to have I2C enabled on the
development platform. Next, we must prepare the Python program used to interface
with the sensors. The program below (solar.py) will show the data gathered by
the sensors in the circuit. It will not successfully run until all the sensors
have been tested and connected. Simply place the file in any directory on the
development platform.

With the development platform now configured, we can move on to the hardware
part of this project.

 

[3.6] PCB Soldering/Testing
---------------------------

The main PCB that holds the I2C circuits, called the Modular Sensor Hat, was
provided by Humber College. The board must first be printed, and the components
aquired (from the Prototype Lab in J building). Solder the components provided
according to the Eagle .brd and .sch files. Be sure to wear safety glasses while
soldering, and consider all aspects of your own (and others') safety.

Caution: There is a problem with the Modular Sensor Hat, we have included a
quote from our instructor regarding the problem below.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"RTC module can charge the CR2032 battery causing damage. To permanently disable the charging circuit, please remove the 200 ohm 
surface mount resistor near the unused I2C header by pushing it off the PCB with a hot soldering iron." 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since this project is not using the RTC, it should not cause a problem, but it
is something to keep in mind when building.

Next, the additional Custom PCB must be printed and soldered. The materials
required for this step are as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
10K Resistor (From Pi Starter Kit)
5-pin Header (x2)
2x20 pin GPIO Header
Short pieces (~2cm) of 22 gauge wire (x3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final step with the boards is to ensure all the connections are working
before connecting them. If faulty boards are connected to sensors (or the
development platform) they can cause permanent damage to either. Save youself
time (and money) by making sure they work before continuing. To do this, power
and ground the boards first. Apply 3.3V to pin 1, and ground pin 6. Now we need
the digital multimeter. Connect the multimeter to the same ground as the
development platform, and use the other connection to probe the different parts
of the circuit. Measure both resistance and voltage, to make sure the values are
correct. If any problems are detected, resoldering may be required. If the
boards pass all the tests, then you are ready to move on.

 

[3.7] Unit Testing Sensors
--------------------------

To test the sensors, first connect the Modular Sensor Hat to your development
platform. Next, connect the barometric pressure sensor to the 4-pin header
labelled "DS-RTC", making sure to match the labels on the board and breakout.
Next, connect the YL-40 board provided in the Humber components pack to the
neighbouring 4-pin header labelled "PCF - ADC", also making sure to match the
labels. Back on the development platform, run the following command to test the
connection to the sensors:

i2cdetect -y 1

The output should contain 48 and 77. To test the Solar Cell, simply connect it
to a multimeter and measure how much voltage is being generated. Try covering it
and moving it closer to light to see if the readings varry. Finally, to test the
DHT-11, connect it to the Pi's GPIO. Make sure to correctly connect ground and
power, as the DHT is fragile. Connect the pin labelled 'S' to pin 7 of the GPIO.
In the solar.py file, comment out lines 26-32. This will mean that only the DHT
will be read from. Run the program using:

python solar.py

If the DHT is functioning, then readings will appear on screen, otherwise the
program will fail to run. If all of the sensors are functioning, you are ready
to connect the circuit.

 

[3.8] Connecting the Circuit
----------------------------

In this step, the mechanical assembly will be complete. The components required
here are:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Broadcom development platform
Modular Sensor Hat
Custom PCB
DHT-11 Humidity & Temperature Sensor
BMP180 Barometric Pressure Sensor
YL-40 Breakout Board
6V Solar Cell
Male-to-female Prototyping Wire (From Canakit Starter Kit)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To assemble the project, follow these steps:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Disconnect the development platform from power
Connect the BMP180 and YL-40 to the Modular Sensor Hat, the same way when you were testing
Install the Modular Sensor Hat on the development platform 3 GPIO header. Connect it so that the Sensor Hat hovers over the 
development platform, and does not extend beyond it
Stack the Custom PCB with the Sensor Hat. This time, make sure the Custom PCB hangs over the edge of the development platform, and 
does NOT hover over the Sensor Hat
Look at the Custom PCB board file. Connect the DHT-11 to the right-hand 5-pin header. Looking at the DHT-11 breakout board, make sure 
that the pins go into the correct header input. Make sure it is properly inserted by following the traces to the GPIO header (G to pin 
6, V to pin 1, S to pin 7)
Connect the Solar Cell to the left-hand 5-pin header. The black wire (ground) should plug into the right-most header input (which is 
connected to GPIO pin 6). The red wire can connect to either header input connected to the 10K resistor
Connect the male end of the prototyping wire to the remaining resistor-connected header input. This will be used to probe the Solar 
Cell. The female end should connect to AIN2 on the top of the YL-40, which leads to an analog-to-digital converter.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Double-check the connections to make sure they are correct. Once you are sure,
power up the development platform. Once the development platform has booted up,
edit the solar.py file again, removing the comment you made in Step 3. Run the
program again, and you should see a flow of readings on the screen. You should
see the LED on the Sensor Hat light up green when everything is working fine. If
it lights up red, that means a sensor is not connected properly. With a
functioning piece of hardware, it is time to make a nice box to put it in.

 

[3.9] Box Creation and Final Assembly
-------------------------------------

It is recommended that clear 3mm acrylic is used for the process, but any
colour/transparency can be used. To print my box, we used Humber's Prototype
Lab, and the helpful staff setup and laser-cut the box for us. It is recommended
that you go to them, or find another professional service, to have the box cut.

Once the box has been cut, use acrylic glue to put everything (except the top)
together. Be careful when using the glue, as it may contain harmful chemicals.
Once everything has dried, you may begin to mount the development platform in
the box. The full drying process may take up to 24 hours, but keep an eye on it
The picture above has the colour-coded bars to represent the sides that go
together. Just follow the lines and make sure the development platform's IO is
accessible when in the box.

The M2.5 kit is required for this step, and you will make sure the development
platform is mounted on the standoffs with its IO ports facing the cutouts
provided. Before securing the development platform, remove the Modular Sensor
Hat from the development platform. Make sure the development platform is
securely mounted (but not too tight) before reconnecting the circuit. Briefly
disconnect the Solar Cell, and reconnect it by feeding the red and black wire
through the holes in the side of the box. The Solar Cell must rest outside of
the box to make sure it generates optimal power. Now just put the top on (do not
glue) and the build is complete. If the circuit is too tall, you may carefully
bend the DHT-11 and AIN2 pin on the YL-40 to accomodate.

 

[3.10] Build Conclusion
-----------------------

By following this guide, you should be able to reproduce this project with
relative ease. While the current construction and parts are great for small
scale use and production (student projects, prototyping), but improvements can
be made that can make production cheaper and quicker.

The Modular Sensor Hat was provided as a general IO board, containing
componenets that can be used for many different sensors and applications. This
can be scaled down and combined with the Custom PCB to reduce the amount of
wasted PCB material and un-needed components. This will reduce the cost, time to
produce, and size of the project. Next, efforts can be made to get the
components cheaper and separate. The Canakit Starter Kit is expensive, and not
all of the parts are used. Finally, with the smaller scale of the project, the
box can be made smaller. Again, smaller means less acrylic is used, and the cost
is reduced.

[4.2] Progress Reports
----------------------

### [4.2.1] Progress Report 3/02/2017

To: Kristian Medri

From: Richard Burak

 

This status report will give you an idea of what our group has done for our
project so far, what we plan to do in the near future, and any problems we have
encountered. This week, Salvatore, Steven, and I have created the skeleton for
our technical report in markdown using Texts. A Requirements Specification is
written within this skeleton, and includes a description of the project and a
breakdown of the work we assigned ourselves to. A template from a book was used
(Wiegers, K. E. (1999). *Software requirements*. Redmond, WA: Microsoft Press).

We have roughly planned out the web interface, and Steven had begun work on a
basic and functional version. It will be hosted on the same co-located server as
the database.

Meanwhile, I have worked on a way to integrate the hardware with the database.
Because many of the PHP scripts were written in the Software Project course, it
was just be a matter of adding code to our Python program. Next, I hope to
explore more ways on managing the data to improve efficiency and add redundancy.

Finally, Salvatore has been working on improving the Android application. The
application is working well, but it could use some polish to be more
presentable, better performing, and more efficient.

Getting used to the markdown language is a challenge, but it is a welcome skill
to our portfolios. The problems encountered were with learning markdown
formatting. The solution was to find online resources to help us learn the
language, as well as ask you for some assistance during class periods.

Financially, no significant changes have been made to the budget. We hope to
improve our hardware by 3D printing a new case component to hold the solar cell
in place on top of the box. This will be free for us at Humber, but we must make
an effort to estimate the cost of this and add it to the budget. All other parts
were purchased last semester, and we have no plans of adding more components to
the hardware.

Regarding progress made in the previous semester, the database and Android
application are mostly complete, and fully integrated with each other. This
means there is less work needed here, and our time can be allocated to other
parts of the project. All of our hardware from last semester is in working
order, but we have decided to use mine as our primary development platform for
this class.

I believe we have solid plan in place for our project, and we hope to remain on
schedule throughout the semester. We do not expect to encounter many problems
during our development, so I am confident we can continue to meet your
expectations with our project.

 

### [4.2.2] Progress Report 16/02/2017

To: Kristian Medri

From: Salvatore Angilletta

 

Over the past two weeks, Richard, Steven and I went to the new prototype lab in
J233 to cut and glue an acrylic holder for our solar cell. We modified the
existing Coral Draw file and laser cut the necessary pieces. We then decided to
glue the pieces together with acrylic cement, and we got to experience the new
venting chamber in the prototype lab.

Development has begun on the online web interface. A working login function has
been created and initial tests for data manipulation have been completed. Our
research into data presentation for HTML5 has lead us to use Chart.js. This is
an open source HTML5 Javascript library that allows us to make our data
presentable in interactive graph form very easily.

Lastly, we have started integration of our hardware with the database. Last
Friday we pushed real data to our database for the first time. A new test user
was created to use this real data across the mobile application and web
interface. Besides little formatting issues, everything pushes fine. More pushes
to the database will occur.

Our report is on track to comply with OACETT standards for technical reports.
Since the last status update we have added and you have looked over our
Introduction, Abstract and Declaration of Authorship sections.

Financially, as stated in the last status report we needed to get an estimate on
how much our solar cell holder would cost. We emailed HotPopFactory.com to get
an estimate for how much the entire case would be as a whole on the
recommendation that you gave us. The estimated price of the entire case with the
new top was about \$31.60. This will be reflected in the budget.

In terms of bugs, we have encountered one in the mobile application. The library
resource we used to display graphs has a known problem for not displaying
anything if you let it dynamically adjust the x or y axis. When we pushed the
real data to the database, there were some issues with displaying the power of
the solar cell. This problem was solved by letting the y axis be a set minimum
of zero.
